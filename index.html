          <h2>Best Leaders</h2>
          <p>
            <time datetime="2015-12-16T22:21">December 16th, 2015 at 10:21PM</time>

        Back during a lot of my leadership training, there was always
        disucssion of what made a great leader. It was probably 4 or 5 years
        later that I came up with an idea.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">A great quality of a leader, is the ability to follow.</p>
        <p>
        This idea was sparked by a conversation I had with my mentor at the
        time. She just got done explaining the team building that happened
        during a leadership conference she went to. Each exercise seemed to be
        more challenging than it should have. As I asked her about the
        difficulty of the new activities, I became so excited about the new
        team building I hadn't experienced before.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is when she explained that these weren't new activities. The
        difficulty was the perception of everyone there. Every member of The
        team thought they were a leader. So when it came time to doing the
        activity, they all knew how it should be done. This caused the group
        to struggle and not accomplish the activities in the allotted time.
        </p>
        <p>
        After a few months of thinking this over, I finally came upon the quote
        I mentioned above. Through team building you learn how to work together
        and accomplish tasks that would be impossible alone. Given a certain
        task, 1 or 2 people will rise up and be the leaders of the group for a
        specific activity. If you then take this same group to another activity,
        it may then be time for another member to lead as they are the one with
        the most experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        This isn't done for the power or the notoriety, but rather for the good
        of the group. It is in those cases, it is best to follow.

          <h2>Disaster Recovery</h2>
          <p>
            <time datetime="2013-02-11T10:43">February 11th, 2013 at 10:43AM</time>

        So I have been in charge of setting up a disastery recovery (DR)
        process. When I first look at what was needed, it became clear I would
        have to walk through all these steps on a clear environment to make
        sure I didn't miss anything. This also made sure that what I recorded
        was actually necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
        I then took this to the next level. Due to the way the system was
        structured in regards to production versus development environments,
        I choose to integrate our DR process tightly with newer releases. This
        causes us to practice DR monthly if not weekly. We were also able to
        find ways to make the whole process easier. Finally, it helped us move
        forward with newer technologies, since we immediately had to figure
        out the deployment process.
        </p>
        <p>
        Whether you are bringing on board new developers or actually having
        to recovery from a failure, weaving this into your everyday process
        turns certain incidents into another common step.

        Anytime I am given any task to complete, I like to know as much about
        what is going on as I can. This lets me make the best call at the time.
        It is also a crucial part of developing software.
        </p>
        <p>
        Too many times, I am getting a demo of the application from a developer
        and it becomes increasingly clear that they really don't understand all
        the business logic that is going on. There is just interpretation of a
        request from users for a feature. Certain features are known to run and
        others are a constant headache for the user.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you don't do user interviews directly and get all your information
        second hand, you will probably always be solving the wrote problem.
        Sure, the user's boss shouldn't be messing up one pass of a phrase in
        the game telephone, but that seems to be the case.
        </p>
        <p>
        Look at the overall picture, do a deep dive when necessary, and broadly
        think how a solution can be created.

        One of the biggest benifits of working on site is the interaction with
        other developers and employees. Yet it seems that communication is
        somewhat lacking. Sure people will wonder around and talk at cubes,
        but most people don't take a break and just relaxing for 15 minutes.
        This can be super useful, whether you talk about work or not.
        </p>
        <p>
        I will however listen to music on my headphones because you have have a
        lot of different conversations going on around you.  I think this job
        is the first time I've ever thought I heard someone saying, "Corporate
        accounts payable, Nina speaking. *JUST a moment." I'm not bothered by
        this, if anything I find it amusing.
        </p>
        <p>
        In a way I think I got lucky. My cube made is an awesome guy and we
        talk about various topics. Seems like everyone uses sarcasm to both
        have fun, but also cover up the negativity. Work is what you make it
        and I'll focus on awesome!
