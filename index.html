          <h2>Best Leaders</h2>

        Back during a lot of my leadership training, there was always
        disucssion of what made a great leader. It was probably 4 or 5 years
        later that I came up with an idea.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">A great quality of a leader, is the ability to follow.</p>
        <p>
        This idea was sparked by a conversation I had with my mentor at the
        time. She just got done explaining the team building that happened
        during a leadership conference she went to. Each exercise seemed to be
        more challenging than it should have. As I asked her about the
        difficulty of the new activities, I became so excited about the new
        team building I hadn't experienced before.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is when she explained that these weren't new activities. The
        difficulty was the perception of everyone there. Every member of The
        team thought they were a leader. So when it came time to doing the
        activity, they all knew how it should be done. This caused the group
        to struggle and not accomplish the activities in the allotted time.
        </p>
        <p>
        After a few months of thinking this over, I finally came upon the quote
        I mentioned above. Through team building you learn how to work together
        and accomplish tasks that would be impossible alone. Given a certain
        task, 1 or 2 people will rise up and be the leaders of the group for a
        specific activity. If you then take this same group to another activity,
        it may then be time for another member to lead as they are the one with
        the most experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        This isn't done for the power or the notoriety, but rather for the good
        of the group. It is in those cases, it is best to follow.
